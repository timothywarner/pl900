# Dataset Overview: Northwind                            
This tutorial uses Northwind, a sample dataset widely used in RDBMS. It is true that the Northwind dataset is mostly used for examples of relational data, but it can be used as examples of graph data as well. This dataset contains sales data of a fictitious company called Northwind Traders, an importer/exporter of specialty foods from/to the global market. 

## Getting Started                                                 
### Prerequisites                   

The goal of this tutorial is to give users guidance in how to load sample data into AgensGraph, query the loaded data, and/or extract the desired information.

In order to load and use data as guided in this tutorial, AgensGraph should be installed first. You can install/use AgensBrowser, a visualization tool, as well, for easier and quicker analysis of the sample data.

In general, there are two ways to load data into AgensGraph:

1. Import dataset files into AgensGraph. 
2. Execute queries on AgensGraph to generate the data
 
This tutorial describes how to import a dataset file (CSV) into AgensGraph. If you want more information on how to generate data using queries, please visit Bitnine's website and read [*Basic Cypher and Advanced Cypher*](http://bitnine.net/learn/) white papers.
